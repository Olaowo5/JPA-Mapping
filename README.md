# JPA-Mapping
This project was an assignment for  CST8277 Enterprise Application Programming course at Algonquin college
The project was designed to map ACME Corp college database scheme to POJOs.
Also, ACME Corp. would like you to write JUnit tests to confirm that the JPA mappings you added are correct. Finally, you
are required to produce a Maven ‘Surefire’ pass-fail report for all of your test cases
